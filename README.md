# Prework Study guide

## Description

This is a project to build a website containing a prework study guide for one to use during their studies at a Full Stack coding bootcamp. I made this project in order to not only catalogue a number of quick notes about HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git, but also to practice all of those very same skills.

## Usage

The usage of this project is fairly straightforward. Once deployed, this is simply a list of notes to be used by the end user for their convenience.
